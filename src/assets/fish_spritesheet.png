This will be a binary file containing the fish animation frames.
You'll need to create this as a PNG spritesheet with 4 frames:
1. Frame 0: Fish in normal position
2. Frame 1: Fish with slight tail bend to the left
3. Frame 2: Fish in normal position again
4. Frame 3: Fish with slight tail bend to the right
