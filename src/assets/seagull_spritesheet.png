This will be a binary file containing the seagull animation frames.
You'll need to create this as a PNG spritesheet with 4 frames:
1. Frame 0: Seagull flying with wings up
2. Frame 1: Seagull flying with wings down
3. Frame 2: Seagull diving with wings partially folded
4. Frame 3: Seagull diving with wings fully folded
